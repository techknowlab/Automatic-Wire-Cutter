# About the Project - Automatic Wire Cutter
For my experiment, I have to cut filament (the feed material used in fused filament fabrication based 3D printing) in small pellets or granules. It was a very time taking and a lot of mannual efforts were involved. Therefore, I thought to make a machine which can cut the filaments automatically into pellets. The idea was converted into a physical object and result is in front of you.
